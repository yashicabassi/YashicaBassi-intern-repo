This plan describes how I will consistently meet the required internship hours as a UX intern.

## Time Logging with Focus Bear
I will run **Focus Bear** during each internship session (Mon, Thu, Fri) to record and verify my hours.  
This provides independent evidence that I am consistently meeting the **15 hours per week** requirement.
