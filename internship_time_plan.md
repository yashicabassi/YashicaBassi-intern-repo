# Internship Time Plan – UX Intern

This plan describes how I will consistently meet the required internship hours as a UX intern.  
I dedicate 15 hours per week to low-fidelity design work and GitHub issue activities.

## Weekly Schedule

### Time Logging with Focus Bear
I will run Focus Bear during each session (Monday, Thursday, Friday) to record and verify my internship hours. This will provide evidence that I’m consistently meeting the required 15 hours per week.
