# üèÜ Cyber Security Guidelines

## üéØ Goal
Understand how to keep company and user data secure by following cyber security best practices.

---

## ‚ùì Why is this important?
Cyber security breaches can lead to data leaks, financial loss, and damage to Focus Bear‚Äôs reputation. Good security habits help protect user data and ensure business continuity. Everyone has a role in keeping information safe.

## üîç Research & Learn

### Common cyber security threats in a remote work environment
- Phishing emails and suspicious links
- Weak passwords or reused passwords
- Unsecured Wi-Fi networks
- Outdated software with security vulnerabilities
- Lost or stolen devices
- Malware and ransomware attacks

---

### Best practices for keeping devices and accounts secure
- Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts.
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible.
- Keep operating systems, browsers, and software updated.
- Use a reputable antivirus and firewall.
- Lock your computer or mobile device when away.
- Avoid using public Wi-Fi or use a secure VPN.

---

### Why it‚Äôs important to lock your computer when away?
Locking your computer prevents unauthorized people from accessing sensitive files, emails, or company systems if you step away. Even a short lapse can be enough for someone to misuse data or cause a breach.

---

### Handling phishing attempts and suspicious links
- Do not click on suspicious links or attachments.
- Double-check sender email addresses.
- Report phishing emails to IT/security immediately.
- If in doubt, verify with the sender through another channel.
- Never provide login details or sensitive information through unsolicited emails.

---

### What makes a strong password and why use a password manager
- A strong password includes at least 12 characters with upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Avoid dictionary words or personal information.
- A password manager helps generate and store strong, unique passwords for every account, so you don‚Äôt reuse them or write them down.

---

### Why two-factor authentication (2FA) is important
2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second verification step (like a code or biometric) in addition to your password. This makes it much harder for attackers to access your accounts, even if your password is compromised. 2FA should be enabled on all accounts that support it.

---

## üìù Reflection

### Security measures I currently follow and areas to improve
I already use strong passwords and keep my devices updated. I lock my screen when away but sometimes forget on my phone. I can improve by enabling 2FA on all work-related accounts and setting shorter auto-lock times.

---

### How I can make secure behaviour a habit
I will regularly review my devices and accounts for security updates, use a password manager to manage unique passwords, and set reminders to change passwords regularly. I‚Äôll treat locking my screen as automatic behaviour, just like logging off.

---

### Steps I will take to keep passwords and accounts secure
- Enable 2FA on all work and personal accounts.
- Use a trusted password manager to generate strong passwords.
- Never reuse passwords across multiple sites.
- Avoid sharing passwords or writing them down.
- Review saved passwords every quarter.

---

### What I would do if I suspected a security breach or suspicious activity
- Report it immediately to my supervisor and the IT/security team.
- Change affected passwords right away.
- Log out of suspicious sessions and devices.
- Follow the company‚Äôs incident response process and cooperate with any investigation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Task

**One new cyber security habit I will follow:**  
I will set my laptop and phone to automatically lock after 2 minutes of inactivity to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
