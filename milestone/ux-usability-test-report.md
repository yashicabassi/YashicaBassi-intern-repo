# 🧾 Focus Bear Usability Test Report

## 👤 Participant Details
- **Age:** 24  
- **Background:** University student, not previously familiar with Focus Bear  
- **Device Used:** iPhone 15

## 🧪 Test Scenario Recap
The participant was asked to imagine they just downloaded Focus Bear to improve their focus. Their task was to set up a 25-minute focus session with distractions blocked.

---

## 📌 Key Observations

- ✅ The participant **quickly found the "Start Focus Session" button** and understood the Pomodoro timer concept.
- ❓ They **hesitated at the distraction blocker screen**, unsure whether it was actively blocking apps or just a suggestion.
- 📱 They **tapped multiple icons expecting more information**, indicating the need for clearer affordances or tooltips.
- 🔄 They **restarted the task once**, thinking they missed a step — the flow was not as linear as they expected.

## 💬 Participant Feedback

- **What was easy?**  
  “The initial screen was really clear. I liked the timer design—it’s calming.”

- **What was confusing?**  
  “I wasn’t sure if the distractions were actually being blocked or if I had to do something more.”

- **Suggestions?**  
  “It would help to have a confirmation like ‘Distraction blocker is now active’ or maybe a checklist of what's blocked.”

- **Would you use it regularly?**  
  “Maybe. It seems useful, but I’d need more clarity upfront on how it works.”

## 🤔 Reflection

### 💥 What surprised me the most?
I expected the participant to struggle with finding the session button, but they actually found it immediately. What surprised me was their uncertainty around the distraction-blocking feature — something I assumed was self-explanatory.

### 🧱 Unexpected Issues?
Yes, the lack of visual confirmation or feedback after activating the distraction blocker created confusion. I didn’t realize that a simple message or animation would make such a big difference in perceived functionality.

### 🧠 How will this inform my UX approach?
This test reminded me of the importance of **clarity and user feedback loops**. Even if a feature works technically, if the user doesn’t feel confident it’s working, the UX has failed. I’ll focus more on **micro-interactions** and onboarding clarity in future designs.
