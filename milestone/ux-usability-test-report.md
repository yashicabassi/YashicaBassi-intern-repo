## 🔮 Reflection

- Observing Suniti showed me how **small design choices**, like where buttons are placed, can significantly affect usability.  
- I was surprised at how much she **wanted to see completed routines**; it was more important to her confidence and motivation than I expected.  
- The lack of a break option disrupted her workflow, highlighting the need for **flexible, user-friendly features**.  
- Seeing her confusion in real time reminded me to always **consider the user’s perspective** — not just what seems intuitive to the designer.  

**Takeaways for UX Design**  
- Keep navigation simple and intuitive for first-time users.  
- Include **visual feedback** like checkmarks, progress summaries, or small animations to enhance engagement.  
- Offer **flexible options** for breaks and reviewing completed routines.  
- Place features where users naturally expect them to improve flow and reduce confusion.
