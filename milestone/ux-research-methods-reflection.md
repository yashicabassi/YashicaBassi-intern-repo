# 📝 UX Research Methods Reflection

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### 🧪 What Are the Two Main Types of UX Research?

1. **Qualitative Research**  
   - Focuses on user behavior, motivations, and emotions.  
   - Gathers in-depth insights from small sample sizes.  
   - Examples: User interviews, usability testing, contextual inquiries.  
   - Best for understanding *why* users behave a certain way.

2. **Quantitative Research**  
   - Focuses on measurable data and trends.  
   - Gathers broad insights from larger populations.  
   - Examples: Surveys, analytics, A/B testing.  
   - Best for identifying *what* is happening and how often.

### 🔍 Common UX Research Methods

- **User Interviews** – In-depth conversations to understand user goals and frustrations.  
- **Usability Testing** – Observing users interact with a product to identify usability issues.  
- **Surveys** – Collecting self-reported feedback at scale.  
- **A/B Testing** – Comparing two versions of a design to see which performs better.  
- **Analytics** – Using behavioral data (clicks, conversions, bounce rates) to identify usage patterns.  
- **Card Sorting & Tree Testing** – Exploring how users understand information architecture.

### 👀 Observational Research vs. Self-Reported Feedback

- **Observational Research**  
  - Involves watching users complete tasks without interference.  
  - Uncovers actual behavior and usability problems users may not articulate.  
  - Best for usability testing, task analysis, or ethnographic studies.

- **Self-Reported Feedback**  
  - Comes from interviews, surveys, and feedback forms.  
  - Useful for capturing opinions, preferences, and attitudes.  
  - May be influenced by memory, perception, or social desirability bias.

### 🌍 Remote vs. In-Person UX Research

**Remote Research**  
- ✅ Benefits:  
  - Easier to access diverse participants  
  - Cost-effective and scalable  
  - Convenient for participants  
- ❌ Limitations:  
  - Harder to observe body language  
  - More prone to technical issues

**In-Person Research**  
- ✅ Benefits:  
  - More controlled environment  
  - Richer insights from physical interaction and facial cues  
- ❌ Limitations:  
  - Costly and time-consuming  
  - Limited geographical reach

## 📝 Reflection

### 💡 If Focus Bear wanted to improve its onboarding experience, which UX research methods would be most useful?

To improve onboarding, I would recommend:  
- **Usability Testing** to watch new users go through the onboarding flow and identify friction points.  
- **User Interviews** to understand users' expectations and mental models before and after onboarding.  
- **Surveys** to collect quick feedback on how helpful or confusing the onboarding process was.

This mixed-method approach allows both in-depth insights and scalable feedback.

### ⚠️ What challenges might arise when collecting self-reported user feedback?

- **Memory Bias**: Users may forget specific steps or misremember their experience.  
- **Social Desirability Bias**: Users may respond in ways they think are expected or acceptable.  
- **Vagueness**: Responses like “It was fine” or “I didn’t like it” lack actionable detail.  
- **Low Response Rates**: Especially in optional surveys, users may not respond unless incentivized.

### 🛡️ How can UX designers avoid bias when conducting research?

- **Ask neutral, open-ended questions**: Avoid wording that leads or suggests a "right" answer.  
- **Avoid over-explaining**: Let users interact naturally to surface genuine issues.  
- **Diversify participant pool**: Ensure you’re not only interviewing users with similar backgrounds or behaviors.  
- **Separate observation from interpretation**: Document what users do/say before adding personal conclusions.

## ✍️ Personal Insight & Authorship Confirmation


While working on this reflection, I gained a deeper appreciation for the complexity and importance of UX research methods. One insight that stood out was how different methods reveal different layers of user experience. For example, **observational research** shows what users *actually* do, which can sometimes contradict what they say in interviews or surveys. This reminded me that people’s self-reported feedback may not always be fully accurate or complete because users often lack awareness of their own behaviors or may not want to share negative experiences directly.

I also reflected on the practical challenges of balancing remote and in-person research. Remote methods are more scalable and inclusive but limit the ability to pick up on subtle cues like body language or frustration, which are often critical to understanding user emotions. This trade-off highlighted for me why combining multiple methods is essential for gaining a comprehensive understanding.

Finally, thinking through the biases that affect self-reported data, like memory and social desirability bias, helped me understand why UX designers must carefully design research questions and approach participants with empathy and neutrality. This reflection not only solidified my theoretical understanding but also made me more aware of how I would approach real-world UX research—by blending methods and remaining cautious about drawing conclusions too quickly.
