## üìå Module 1: Agile Principles & Frameworks

### üîç Research & Learn

---

### What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?

Agile is an iterative approach to software and product development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement. Unlike traditional ‚ÄúWaterfall‚Äù project management ‚Äî which follows a strict, linear sequence of planning, design, build, and test ‚Äî Agile breaks work into smaller, manageable pieces called iterations or increments.

In Agile, teams deliver usable parts of the product frequently and adapt based on feedback. This helps teams respond to change quickly rather than sticking rigidly to a plan created at the start. Communication with stakeholders is ongoing, and priorities can shift based on real user needs.

### What are the core values and principles of Agile?  

According to the **Agile Manifesto**, the four core values are:

1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools  
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation  
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation  
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan  

**Principles support these values, including:**
- Deliver working software frequently.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.
- Work together daily.
- Build projects around motivated individuals.
- Keep things simple.
- Reflect regularly to improve.

### What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?

**Scrum** and **Kanban** are both Agile frameworks, but they have key differences:

- **Scrum**:
  - Work is organized in **fixed-length sprints** (usually 1‚Äì4 weeks).
  - The team commits to a **sprint backlog** at the start and aims to complete it by the end.
  - Roles are clearly defined: Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team.
  - Includes ceremonies like daily stand-ups, sprint planning, sprint reviews, and retrospectives.
  - Best for teams that benefit from structured, time-boxed work and clear increments.

- **Kanban**:
  - Work is **continuous** with no fixed sprints.
  - Uses a **visual board** to track tasks through stages (To Do ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Done).
  - Focuses on **limiting work in progress (WIP)** to avoid overload.
  - Flexible ‚Äî new tasks can be added anytime.
  - No specific roles or events required.
  - Best for teams with continuous, incoming work and changing priorities.

---

### Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?

Focus Bear prefers Kanban because:
- Work is often continuous and evolving rather than delivered in fixed increments.
- The team needs flexibility to adapt quickly as priorities shift.
- Kanban makes it easy to visualize tasks and limit work in progress.
- There may not be enough need for formal Scrum roles and ceremonies when the focus is on ongoing improvements.

## üìù Reflection

---

### What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?

**Benefits**:
- Faster delivery of usable work.
- Better alignment with real user needs.
- Ability to adapt quickly to feedback or changes.
- Greater transparency and team ownership.

**Challenges**:
- Requires strong communication and self-discipline.
- Changing requirements can feel chaotic if not managed well.
- Needs buy-in from all team members to work effectively.
- Can be hard for people used to rigid plans.

---

### How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?

Agile encourages regular check-ins and feedback, which helps me catch mistakes early and stay focused on what matters most. Working in small, manageable chunks reduces overwhelm and improves productivity. Emphasizing teamwork and communication means I can ask for help and share progress openly. Being flexible about change also keeps me ready to adjust priorities without feeling stuck.

## üõ†Ô∏è Task

---

### Summary: Main differences between Scrum and Kanban (in my own words)

- **Scrum** uses sprints ‚Äî short, fixed periods with set goals ‚Äî and has clear roles and ceremonies to keep work structured.
- **Kanban** is continuous ‚Äî tasks flow steadily through a visual board with no time-boxed sprints.
- Scrum suits projects that benefit from strict planning and team rituals; Kanban works well for flexible teams with changing tasks and ongoing work.

**‚ÄúWelcome changing requirements, even late in development.‚Äù**  
This principle reminds me to stay flexible and open to feedback, so I can adjust my work to better meet user needs instead of sticking to a plan that
