# Kanban Workflow

## üîç Research & Learn

### How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?

A Kanban board is a visual tool that helps teams manage and track the flow of work. Tasks are represented as cards that move through columns reflecting stages of the workflow. By visualizing work, teams can see what is being worked on, what is pending, and what is completed. This transparency improves collaboration, highlights bottlenecks, and supports continuous delivery.

### What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent?

- **Backlog**: Tasks that are ready to be picked up but haven‚Äôt been started yet.  
- **In Progress**: Tasks currently being worked on.  
- **Blocked**: Tasks that can‚Äôt move forward due to an issue or dependency.  
- **Done**: Completed tasks that meet the Definition of Done.  

### How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?

Tasks move from one column to the next as work progresses. Team members are responsible for moving their own tasks and updating their status to reflect the current state. This ensures the board is accurate and up-to-date for everyone.

### What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?

Limiting WIP prevents team members from starting too many tasks at once, reducing context-switching and helping maintain focus. It encourages the team to finish existing work before starting new tasks, improving flow efficiency and minimizing bottlenecks.

## üìù Reflection

### How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?

Kanban makes priorities visible by showing the current state of all tasks. WIP limits help ensure individuals and teams aren‚Äôt overloaded, allowing them to focus on completing high-priority tasks first and maintain a sustainable workflow.

### How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?

I can improve my workflow by setting clear WIP limits, regularly reviewing and reprioritizing tasks, and updating task statuses promptly. This helps me focus on completing one task at a time, reduces distractions, and improves consistency in delivery.

## üõ†Ô∏è Task

- **Checked Focus Bear‚Äôs Kanban board in GitHub Projects.**  
- **Task moved through the Kanban process:**  
  - **Task Name:** `UI UX Mobile ToDo Player`  
  - **Status moved:** Backlog ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Done  
  - **Details:**  
    - Priority: Low  
    - Assignee: Yashica  
    - Description: The focus session should display goals sourced directly from the user‚Äôs to-do list. Users can access the To-Do Player by starting a work session. During a focus session, users should be able to edit tasks without leaving the session. This feature integrates the to-do list with the focus session timer for a distraction-free workflow.  
    - Expected Result: Low fidelity prototype for feedback; high fidelity prototype for implementation ready.  
    - Iteration: 2 (Aug 24 - Sep 6)  
  - **Evidence:** Screenshot attached showing my GitHub username and the task movement on the Kanban board.

- **One improvement for task tracking:**  
  Adding clear acceptance criteria and attaching relevant Figma prototypes directly to the task card will make it easier to know when the task is complete and reduce back-and-forth clarification.
