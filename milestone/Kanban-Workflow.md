# Kanban Workflow

## üîç Research & Learn

### How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?

A Kanban board is a visual tool that helps teams manage and track the flow of work. Tasks are represented as cards that move through columns reflecting stages of the workflow. By visualizing work, teams can see what is being worked on, what is pending, and what is completed. This transparency improves collaboration, identifies bottlenecks, and supports continuous delivery.

### What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent?

- **Backlog**: Tasks that are ready to be picked up but haven‚Äôt been started yet.
- **In Progress**: Tasks currently being worked on.
- **Blocked**: Tasks that can‚Äôt move forward due to an issue or dependency.
- **Done**: Completed tasks that meet the Definition of Done.

### How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?

Tasks move from one column to the next as work progresses. Team members are responsible for moving their own tasks and updating their status to reflect the current state. This keeps the board accurate and up-to-date for everyone.

### What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?

Limiting WIP prevents team members from starting too many tasks at once, which reduces context-switching and helps maintain focus. It encourages the team to finish existing work before starting new tasks, which improves flow efficiency and reduces bottlenecks.

## üìù Reflection

### How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?

Kanban makes priorities visible and manageable by showing the current state of tasks and their flow. WIP limits ensure that individuals and teams are not overloaded with too many tasks, helping them focus on completing high-priority work first and maintaining a sustainable pace.

### How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?

I can improve my workflow by setting clear WIP limits, regularly reviewing the board to reprioritize tasks, and making sure I update task statuses promptly. This will help me focus on finishing one task at a time, reduce distractions, and deliver work more consistently.

## üõ†Ô∏è Task

- **Checked Focus Bear‚Äôs Kanban board in GitHub Projects:**  
- **Moved a task through the Kanban process and updated its status correctly:**  
- **One improvement for task tracking:**  
  I can improve task tracking by adding clear acceptance criteria to each task card. This will make it easier to know when work is truly done and prevent tasks from bouncing back and forth due to unclear requirements.
