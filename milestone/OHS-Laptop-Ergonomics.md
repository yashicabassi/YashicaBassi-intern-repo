# Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) for Desk-Based Work

## 🎯 Goal  
Set up a safe, comfortable, and ergonomic workspace for using my laptop, and build better habits to avoid physical strain and discomfort.

---

## ❓ Why is this important?  
Working directly on a laptop for long hours often leads to poor posture, which causes neck and shoulder pain, back aches, and wrist strain. Making simple changes to how I sit and how my workspace is set up can help me avoid these issues and stay comfortable and focused for longer periods.

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### Risks of using a laptop without an external monitor or keyboard:
Using just a laptop means the screen is usually too low, so I tend to hunch my shoulders and bend my neck down. Over time this can cause neck and upper back pain. Also, the built-in keyboard and trackpad force my wrists into awkward positions, which can cause discomfort or repetitive strain injuries. Eye strain is also common if the screen is too close or not at the right height.

### Ergonomic equipment to improve posture:
Some things I can add to my setup:
- A laptop stand or riser to lift the screen to eye level.
- An external keyboard and mouse to keep my wrists straight and shoulders relaxed.
- An adjustable chair with good back support.
- A separate monitor if needed for more screen space.

### Key adjustments for monitor height, chair, and desk setup:
- The top of the laptop screen or external monitor should be at or just below eye level.
- The screen should be about an arm’s length away.
- My chair height should let my feet rest flat on the floor.
- My elbows should also be at about a 90-degree angle when typing, with wrists in a neutral position.
- We can also use a cushion for extra back support.

### Daily habits to reduce strain from laptop use:
- Take short movement breaks at least every 30 to 45 minutes.
- Do a quick posture check every now and then to sit up straight and relax my shoulders.
- Follow the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds to rest my eyes.
- Stretch my neck, shoulders, wrists, and back during breaks.

## 📝 Reflection

### Equipment changes I can make:
I plan to start using a laptop stand to lift my laptop higher. I will connect an external keyboard and mouse so my wrists stay straight and relaxed. I also check if my current chair gives enough lower back support — if not, I’ll add a cushion or look for a more ergonomic chair.

### Behavioural changes I can implement:
I’ll remind myself to sit upright instead of slouching. I want to take a short stretch or walk break every 30–45 minutes so I don’t stay in one position too long. I’ll also make sure my screen stays at eye level, so I’m not bending my neck forward.

### How I can remind myself:
I can use Focus Bear to schedule regular stretch and posture reminders throughout the day. I might also put a sticky note on my laptop that says “Check your posture!” to keep it top of mind. I’ll set a phone alarm if needed to make sure I don’t forget to take breaks.

## 🛠️ Task

- I adjusted my laptop using a stand to raise the screen.
- I started using an external screen,keyboard and mouse for better wrist position.
- I tested Focus Bear for reminders and it helped me move more.
- I started taking break for 5 min every 45 minutes I work and also started using 20-20-20 rule.
