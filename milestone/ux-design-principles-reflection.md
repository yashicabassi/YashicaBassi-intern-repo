## 🔍 Research & Learn  

**What are Focus Bear’s design priorities?**  
Focus Bear emphasizes:  
- **Simplicity** – Reduce clutter and complexity.  
- **Low-friction interactions** – Help users complete tasks with minimal effort.  
- **Accessibility** – Support all users, especially those with ADHD, autism, or sensory sensitivities, by minimizing cognitive load and distractions.  

**How should UI elements, colors, and typography support neurodivergent users?**  
- Use a **clear visual hierarchy** with consistent spacing, alignment, and sizing.  
- Ensure **high-contrast colors** and **dyslexia-friendly fonts**.  
- Apply **consistent iconography** for predictability.  
- Avoid flashing animations; use calm, muted tones to prevent overstimulation.  

**Why does consistency in navigation & interaction patterns matter?**  
- Predictability lowers the learning curve.  
- Familiar button placements, labels, and gestures reduce cognitive effort.  
- Especially for neurodivergent users, avoiding unexpected changes maintains comfort and focus.  

**How can small UI details improve or harm usability?**  
- **Improve:** Clear tooltips, logical button placement, smooth non-distracting animations.  
- **Harm:** Misplaced buttons, poor spacing, unnecessary transitions that cause friction or confusion.

## 📝 Reflection  

**🧘 How can Focus Bear maintain a minimal, distraction-free UI while still offering powerful features?**  
- Use **progressive disclosure** – keep the core UI clean, reveal advanced options when needed.  
- Employ **toggles, tabs, or collapsible menus** to hide non-essential features.  
- Use **tooltips and onboarding cues** to guide without clutter.  
- Design each screen around **one primary goal** with minimal branching.  

**🎭 If a design change improves aesthetics but reduces usability, how should UX handle it?**  
- **Prioritize function over form.**  
- Reassess changes that harm usability.  
- Explore alternatives or test with real users (A/B testing).  
- Keep accessibility and ease of use above visual appeal.  

**⚖️ Risks of overloading users with too many choices or settings:**  
- **Decision fatigue** and increased cognitive load.  
- Overwhelm, leading to task abandonment.  
- For neurodivergent users: greater difficulty navigating dense menus or frequent settings changes.  
- Mitigate by using **smart defaults**, minimal configuration, and optional customisation tucked away.

## 📖 Personal Anecdote  
When I first started using Focus Bear, the **"Morning Routine"** screen immediately stood out for its clarity—it presented only three key options without extra clutter. This made it easy to start my day without getting lost in settings or features. In contrast, I’ve used other productivity apps that opened with a dashboard packed with metrics, task lists, and tips all at once. I found myself clicking between tabs without actually starting any work, which felt overwhelming and unproductive. The difference made me realise how **a focused, minimal interface directly impacts my ability to get into flow quickly**.

By committing to **simplicity, clarity, and accessibility**, Focus Bear can empower all users—especially those who are neurodivergent—to stay focused and in control. Every design decision, no matter how small, shapes both the **emotional** and **functional** quality of the product.
