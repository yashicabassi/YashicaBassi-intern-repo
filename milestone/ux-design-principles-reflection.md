## üîç Research & Learn

### What are Focus Bear‚Äôs design priorities?
Focus Bear emphasizes **simplicity**, **low-friction interactions**, and **accessibility**. Every design decision should minimize cognitive load, support user focus, and help users complete tasks with as little confusion or distraction as possible.

### How should UI elements, colors, and typography support neurodivergent users?
UI elements should follow a clear visual hierarchy, with consistent spacing, alignment, and sizing. High-contrast colors, dyslexia-friendly fonts, and consistent iconography help reduce confusion. Avoiding flashing animations and using calm, muted tones can reduce overstimulation for users with ADHD or sensory sensitivities.

### Why does consistency in navigation & interaction patterns matter for usability?
Consistency builds **predictability**, which lowers the mental effort required to learn or use the app. When users can rely on familiar button placements, labels, or gestures, they spend less time figuring out how to interact and more time completing tasks. This is especially critical for neurodivergent users, who may become overwhelmed by unexpected changes.

### How can small UI details improve or harm usability?
Details like tooltip clarity, button placement, or smooth (non-distracting) animations can enhance understanding and user confidence. However, poorly placed buttons, lack of spacing, or unnecessary transitions can create friction, misclicks, or confusion‚Äîespecially for users with attention regulation difficulties.

## üìù Reflection

### üßò How can Focus Bear maintain a minimal, distraction-free UI while still offering powerful features?
The key is to **progressively disclose** complexity‚Äîkeep the core UI clean and only reveal advanced options when needed. Use toggles, tabs, or collapsible menus to hide non-essential features. Tooltips and onboarding cues can offer guidance without visual clutter. Focus Bear should also prioritize **task-oriented workflows**, ensuring that each screen supports a single goal with minimal branching paths.

### üé≠ If a design change improves aesthetics but reduces usability, how should UX handle it?
UX designers should prioritize **function over form**. If a change looks better but creates confusion or friction, it needs to be re-evaluated. The team can explore alternative designs that strike a better balance or test the aesthetic change through user feedback or A/B testing. Accessibility and ease of use should always outweigh surface-level visual appeal.

### ‚öñÔ∏è What are the risks of overloading users with too many choices or settings?
Too many options can cause **decision fatigue**, increase **cognitive load**, and lead users to feel overwhelmed or abandon tasks. Neurodivergent users, in particular, may find it difficult to navigate dense settings menus or make frequent configuration decisions. Focus Bear should offer **smart defaults**, minimal configuration requirements, and optional customization that is tucked away unless explicitly needed.
