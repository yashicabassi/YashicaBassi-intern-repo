# 🏆 Milestone: Wireframing & Prototyping  

## ✏️ Project Title: *To-Do Player*  

---

### 🎯 Goal  
To create low-fidelity wireframes for the **To-Do Player**, an interactive productivity tool where a bear collects honey as the user focuses on completing tasks.  

The goal of this phase is to establish the **layout, navigation, and task flow** for the app before adding visual details.  

---

### ❓ Why is this important?  
Low-fidelity wireframes help visualize how users will **navigate between the task list, focus session, and reward system** without being distracted by colors or illustrations.  
For the *To-Do Player*, it ensures that the experience of managing tasks and tracking focus sessions is both **intuitive and engaging** before moving into the high-fidelity stage.

### 🔍 Research & Learn  

#### What are low-fidelity wireframes, and why are they useful?  
Low-fidelity wireframes are simple, structural representations of an interface. For *To-Do Player*, they helped define how features like the **task list**, **focus timer**, and **progress reward** connect together.  
They allowed for quick testing and iteration to make sure the user flow felt natural.  

#### How do low-fi wireframes help speed up the design process?  
They enable faster testing and feedback loops. In this project, low-fi wireframes made it easy to adjust navigation between “Todos”, “Focus Session”, and “Completion” screens based on supervisor feedback without redoing visual assets.  

#### What tool was used for low-fi wireframing?  
- **Figma** – used for creating all low-fidelity wireframes in this project.  

#### How do UX teams use wireframes for early feedback and iteration?  
Teams use wireframes to communicate and validate user flow early. For *To-Do Player*, the wireframes were shared with the supervisor (Mia) for critique, helping refine the flow from **task setup → focus timer → reward**.

### 📝 Reflection  

#### How can low-fidelity wireframes help avoid costly design mistakes?  
They prevent misalignment on core functionality and navigation. For *To-Do Player*, early feedback caught issues like unclear time-setting interactions and missing visual cues between screens — saving time before high-fidelity prototyping.  

#### If a stakeholder wants to skip to high-fidelity design, how would you explain the value of low-fi wireframing?  
I’d explain that low-fi wireframes act as the **blueprint** for the app. Jumping straight to polished visuals risks missing core logic or usability flaws.  
It’s more efficient to confirm structure and flow first — just like architects plan the layout before painting the walls.  

#### What are some common mistakes designers make when creating wireframes?  
- Using colors or detailed icons too early  
- Ignoring information hierarchy  
- Forgetting to label interactive elements  
- Not testing user flow between pages

### 🛠️ Task  

1. Reviewed usability test findings from **ux-usability-test-report.md**.  
2. Confirmed the *To-Do Player* concept with supervisor **Mia**.  
3. Sketched and built key screens in **Figma**, including:  
   - Home / Todos Page  
   - Prepare Task (Set Timer)  
   - Focus Session (Bear collecting honey)  
   - Celebration / Completion Page  
4. Shared the Figma file for critique and iterated based on feedback.

### 💬 Summary  

The low-fidelity wireframes for the *To-Do Player* laid the foundation for a smooth and engaging user experience.  
They mapped out how users:  
- View and select tasks  
- Set focus durations  
- Watch progress through the bear’s honey-collecting journey  
- Celebrate completion with rewards  

These wireframes guided the transition into high-fidelity prototyping, ensuring that every screen supported a playful yet structured focus flow.
