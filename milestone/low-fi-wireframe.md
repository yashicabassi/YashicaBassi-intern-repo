## 🔍 Research & Learn

**What are low-fidelity wireframes and why are they useful?**  

Low-fidelity wireframes are simple, schematic representations of a user interface. They focus on layout, hierarchy, and functionality rather than visual design. They are useful for testing ideas quickly and iterating early, saving time and reducing design errors.

**How do low-fi wireframes help speed up the design process?**  
- Allow rapid prototyping and quick changes.  
- Encourage feedback before investing in high-fidelity visuals.  
- Highlight usability issues early in the design process.

**Tools for low-fi wireframing:**  
- Figma (frames, shapes, simple annotations)  
- Paper sketches or whiteboard drawings  
- Balsamiq or Adobe XD (simple wireframe modes)

**How UX teams use wireframes for early feedback and iteration:**  
- Share wireframes with stakeholders for quick reviews.  
- Conduct usability tests with simplified layouts.  
- Identify navigation or content placement issues before visual design.

## 📝 Reflection

**How low-fi wireframes help avoid costly design mistakes:**  
By testing the layout, flow, and structure early, you can prevent issues like confusing navigation, missing elements, or content misplacement that would be expensive to fix in high-fidelity designs.

**Explaining the value of low-fi wireframes to stakeholders:**  
“Jumping straight to high-fidelity design may look polished, but it’s harder to fix mistakes. Low-fidelity wireframes let us validate structure and usability first, saving time, cost, and frustration.”

**Common mistakes designers make when creating wireframes:**  
- Adding unnecessary colors or fonts (loses focus on usability)  
- Overloading with too much content too early  
- Ignoring mobile/responsive layouts  
- Skipping user flow validation
