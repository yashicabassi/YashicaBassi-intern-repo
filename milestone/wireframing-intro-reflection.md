# üìù Wireframing Introduction Reflection

## What is a wireframe, and how does it differ from a prototype?

A **wireframe** is a simple, low-detail visual representation of a user interface focusing on layout, structure, and key elements without detailed styling or interaction. It acts as a blueprint that shows where content and controls will be placed.

A **prototype**, on the other hand, is a more advanced model that simulates the actual functionality of the interface. Prototypes can be low-fidelity or high-fidelity, but they include interactive elements to mimic user experience and allow usability testing of workflows.

## What are the key differences between low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes?

- **Low-fidelity wireframes** are basic sketches or digital outlines focusing on layout and flow without colors, fonts, or detailed graphics. They are quick to produce and easy to change.
  
- **High-fidelity wireframes** have more detail, including typography, spacing, grayscale or limited colors, and sometimes basic interactivity. They bridge the gap between wireframes and prototypes.

## When should wireframes be used in the UX design process?

Wireframes should be used early in the design process:
- After initial research and requirement gathering.
- Before visual design and prototyping.
- To explore multiple layout options quickly.
- To facilitate discussion among designers, stakeholders, and developers.
- To identify usability issues early.

## How do wireframes improve collaboration between UX, PMs, and developers?

Wireframes serve as a clear, visual communication tool:
- **UX designers** use wireframes to explain design concepts and user flows.
- **Product Managers (PMs)** can easily provide feedback on scope and feature placement without being distracted by visual details.
- **Developers** gain a clear understanding of what needs to be built, helping estimate effort and identify technical constraints early.

This shared understanding helps align teams and reduces miscommunication.

## What are the benefits of starting with wireframes rather than jumping into high-fidelity design?

- Saves time by focusing on structure first.
- Encourages rapid iteration and feedback.
- Highlights usability and flow issues early.
- Avoids costly rework by catching fundamental problems before detailed design.
- Keeps discussions focused on functionality, not aesthetics.

## How can wireframes help identify usability issues early?

Because wireframes emphasize layout and navigation without visual styling, users and stakeholders focus on how the interface works rather than how it looks. This clarity helps uncover issues such as confusing navigation paths, missing features, or unclear content hierarchy early in the process.

## If a stakeholder asks for a high-fidelity design too soon, how would you explain the value of wireframing?

I would explain that wireframes are the foundation for good design ‚Äî like a blueprint for a building. Starting with high-fidelity design too soon can waste time if major layout or flow issues arise later. Wireframes allow quick testing and alignment on core functionality before spending time on visual polish, ultimately saving time and money while reducing risk.
