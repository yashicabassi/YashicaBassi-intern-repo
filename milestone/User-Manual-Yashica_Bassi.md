## 📝 Reflection

### What I need from teammates
I appreciate clear and direct communication, detailed instructions when needed, and realistic deadlines. A bit of flexibility is always helpful, and I do my best work when interruptions are kept to a minimum during deep focus time.

### How I prefer to communicate
I prefer clear and concise async messages for most things. For more complex topics or when collaboration is needed, I like short video calls or quick check-ins that are scheduled in advance.

### What helps me stay focused
A quiet workspace and dedicated blocks of time for deep work help me stay productive. I rely on structured to-do lists and clear priorities. Sometimes, light background music helps me concentrate.

### How I like to give and receive feedback
I appreciate feedback that is clear, respectful, and constructive — ideally with examples so I know exactly what to improve. Positive reinforcement is always motivating. I am comfortable with both written and verbal feedback, but I prefer it to be shared privately if it’s about areas for improvement.

### Quirks about my work style
I sometimes need a bit of time to process ideas before sharing my thoughts — silence usually means I’m thinking things through. I appreciate clear, written instructions and like to take time to organise my ideas before group discussions.
