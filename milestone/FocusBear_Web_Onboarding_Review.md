## Observations

### 1. Confusing Sign-Up Option
- **Issue:** The “Start with Google” button is misleading; it gives the impression it will initiate a Google search instead of signing up with a Gmail account.
- **Observed Behaviour:** Upon visiting the landing page, I hesitated before clicking the button, unsure if I would be redirected outside the app. This caused a minor delay in completing the onboarding.
- **Expected Behaviour:** The label should clearly indicate the action, e.g., “Sign up with Google” or “Continue with Google,” ideally with the Google “G” logo for clarity.
- **Steps to Reproduce:** 
  1. Navigate to the Focus Bear landing page.
  2. Locate the social sign-up buttons.
  3. Observe the label on the Google sign-up button.
- **User Impact:** Confusion at the start of onboarding may reduce trust and increase drop-offs.
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Screenshot:** ![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39bede4c-c89c-42b9-b9dc-a2445e6c3832)
- **Suggestion:** Change the label to “Sign up with Google,” add a tooltip explaining the action, and include the Google logo for visual clarity.

### 2. Headings Capitalization
- **Issue:** The main heading “CREATE YOUR ACCOUNT” uses all capital letters, which negatively affects readability.
- **Observed Behaviour:** The all-caps heading felt like shouting, slowing my reading and comprehension. It appeared less approachable and more formal than needed for a friendly onboarding flow.
- **Expected Behaviour:** Use sentence case: “Create your account,” which improves scanning speed and readability without changing emphasis.
- **Steps to Reproduce:** 
  1. Open the sign-up form page.
  2. Observe the primary heading at the top of the page.
- **User Impact:** Reduced readability may frustrate new users and negatively influence first impressions.
- **Severity:** Low
- **Screenshot:** ![6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fd981ab-15a7-4a14-a430-a7145a8e8d92)
- **Suggestion:** Update the heading to sentence case and maintain bold styling for emphasis.

### 3. Checkbox Visibility
- **Issue:** Unchecked checkboxes are difficult to distinguish due to low contrast and can appear partially selected.
- **Observed Behaviour:** I clicked multiple times on consent checkboxes (e.g., marketing or terms acceptance) because it was unclear whether my selection registered.
- **Expected Behaviour:** Unchecked and checked states should be visually distinct with high contrast. Checkboxes should have clear labels and large enough hit targets.
- **Steps to Reproduce:** 
  1. Navigate to the account creation page.
  2. Locate all consent and terms checkboxes.
  3. Observe visual clarity and attempt to select/deselect them.
- **User Impact:** Confusion regarding consent selection may reduce trust, leading to potential errors in agreement selections.
- **Severity:** High
- **Screenshot:** ![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64db5c8d-b7ea-4f26-af7d-6da5a07e1470)
- **Suggestion:** Increase contrast, add visible checkmarks for checked states, ensure a minimum 44x44px clickable area, and allow label click to toggle selection.

### 4. Overlapping Buttons
- **Issue:** Some buttons overlap on smaller screens or certain viewport sizes.
- **Observed Behaviour:** While attempting to proceed through the onboarding steps, I accidentally clicked the wrong button due to overlapping, which caused frustration and a minor workflow disruption.
- **Expected Behaviour:** Buttons should have sufficient spacing or stack vertically on smaller screens to prevent accidental clicks.
- **Steps to Reproduce:** 
  1. Complete a step in the onboarding flow.
  2. Observe buttons at the bottom of the form.
  3. Resize the browser to smaller widths (e.g., 1366x768) and check for overlap.
- **User Impact:** Users may make unintended choices, slowing onboarding or causing errors.
- **Severity:** High
- **Screenshot:** ![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecfb9450-b097-4b75-afd4-687cf07750c6)
- **Suggestion:** Implement responsive layout adjustments; add minimum spacing between buttons; stack buttons vertically on narrow screens.

### 5. Goal Sorting & Exit Options
- **Issue:** Users cannot reorder their goals easily, and there is no clear way to cancel or exit goal entry screens.
- **Observed Behaviour:** When adding multiple goals, I could not reorder them, and the only way to exit a modal was to refresh the page, which is disruptive.
- **Expected Behaviour:** Goals should be reorderable via drag-and-drop or up/down controls. Cancel or exit buttons should be visible and functional.
- **Steps to Reproduce:** 
  1. Add multiple goals during onboarding.
  2. Attempt to reorder goals.
  3. Attempt to cancel or exit the modal.
- **User Impact:** Users may feel frustrated or trapped, potentially abandoning onboarding.
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Screenshot:** ![4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8585b492-5099-4a91-b0a1-7c2b4f5312b1)
- **Suggestion:** Implement drag-and-drop or control arrows for reordering; provide clear cancel/save buttons.

### 6. Background Image Affects Text Readability
- **Issue:** Text over some background images is hard to read due to low contrast.
- **Observed Behaviour:** Instructions and tips were difficult to read at a glance, particularly small gray text over busy images.
- **Expected Behaviour:** Add semi-transparent overlay, blur background, or increase text contrast for better readability.
- **Steps to Reproduce:** 
  1. Visit the welcome or hero screen.
  2. Observe text overlay on background images.
- **User Impact:** Users may misread instructions or skip important information, affecting onboarding success.
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Screenshot:** ![5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19dddcb6-f640-4dda-87a0-21254e0b8f0a)
- **Suggestion:** Apply a semi-transparent overlay, increase text size and weight, or adjust background brightness.
