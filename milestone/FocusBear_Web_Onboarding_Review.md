# Focus Bear Web Onboarding Review

## Observations

### 1. Confusing Sign-Up Option
- **Issue:** The “Start with Google” button gives the impression it will open a Google search, rather than signing up with a Gmail account.  
- **Screenshot:** ![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39bede4c-c89c-42b9-b9dc-a2445e6c3832)
- **Suggestion:** Update the text to “Sign up with Google” to clarify the action.

### 2. Headings Capitalization
- **Issue:** “Create Your Account” is written in all capital letters, which makes it harder to read.  
- **Screenshot:**  ![6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fd981ab-15a7-4a14-a430-a7145a8e8d92)
- **Suggestion:** Use sentence case (“Create your account”) for better readability.


### 3. Checkbox Visibility
- **Issue:** Unchecked checkboxes are hard to distinguish due to low contrast and can appear partially selected.  
- **Screenshot:**  ![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64db5c8d-b7ea-4f26-af7d-6da5a07e1470)
- **Suggestion:** Improve the contrast so users can clearly see whether a box is checked or unchecked.

### 4. Overlapping Buttons
- **Issue:** Some buttons overlap, which can make navigation frustrating on the web interface.  
- **Screenshot:** ![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecfb9450-b097-4b75-afd4-687cf07750c6)
- **Suggestion:** Adjust the layout to prevent overlap and ensure all buttons are easily clickable.

### 5. Goal Sorting & Exit Options
- **Issue:** Users cannot reorder their goals easily, and there is no clear way to cancel or exit certain screens.  
- **Screenshot:**  ![4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8585b492-5099-4a91-b0a1-7c2b4f5312b1)
- **Suggestion:** Enable goal sorting and provide a clear “Cancel/Exit” option.


### 6. Background Image Affects Text Readability
- **Issue:** The background image on some screens makes the text harder to read due to low contrast.  
- **Screenshot:** ![5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19dddcb6-f640-4dda-87a0-21254e0b8f0a)
- **Suggestion:** Adjust the background image (e.g., add a semi-transparent overlay) or improve text contrast to ensure readability.
