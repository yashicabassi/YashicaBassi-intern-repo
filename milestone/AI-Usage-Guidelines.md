## 🖋️ Personal Example of Using ChatGPT

While drafting this AI tools guideline, I actively interacted with ChatGPT to create the initial structure and content. For example, I asked ChatGPT to generate a list of common benefits and risks of AI in the workplace. The first draft it gave me was a good start but lacked concrete examples and missed the point about data privacy concerns. 

I then edited the AI output by adding specific examples like “never input client names or passwords” and emphasized company policy on confidentiality. I also reorganized the sections for better flow, grouping “when to use AI” and “when to rely on my skills” clearly.

This iterative editing process—prompting ChatGPT, reviewing its answers, and refining them—helped me understand how AI can assist but must be critically evaluated and customized before use. It reflects my personal workflow of treating AI as a tool that supports but doesn’t replace my own judgment.
