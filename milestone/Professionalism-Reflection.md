## 📝 Reflection

### A time I saw great teamwork and professionalism  
I once worked on a group project where everyone communicated clearly and shared updates regularly. We gave each other honest but kind feedback, which helped us finish on time and stay motivated. What made it work was that everyone respected each other’s ideas and spoke up if there were problems.

### Steps to make sure my communication is clear and respectful  
- Double-check messages for tone and clarity before sending  
- Use positive language whenever possible  
- Keep everyone who needs to know in the loop  
- Ask for clarification if I don’t understand something

### How I can help create a positive, fun, and professional environment  
- Bringing good energy to calls and meetings  
- Be friendly and supportive in messages  
- Celebrate wins together  
- Speak up if I see unkind or unprofessional behaviour  
- Share ideas and listen to others’ ideas with an open mind

### How to prepare for meetings  
- Make a quick agenda or list of questions beforehand  
- Review past notes or tasks so I’m up to date  
- Be ready to share progress or blockers honestly  
- Join calls on time and stay focused

### What being proactive during my internship looks like  
- Taking initiative on tasks instead of waiting to be told every step  
- Suggesting solutions if I run into problems  
- Asking for more work if I finish early  
- Sharing ideas that could help the team

### How I would follow up or escalate  
- If I need information, I’ll send a clear message or email with the context and a polite request  
- If I don’t get a reply in a reasonable time, I’ll follow up once or twice, then mention it nicely in a call  
- If it’s urgent or serious, I’ll escalate to a supervisor or, if needed, use the CEO’s phone number for major issues

### Some things I won’t do  
- I won’t gossip or complain about teammates behind their backs  
- I won’t ignore messages or tasks I’m responsible for  
- I won’t use negative or rude language in chats or calls  
- I won’t blame others for my mistakes — I’ll own them and learn from them
