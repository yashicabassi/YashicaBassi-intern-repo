## 🔍 Research & Learn

### 🕘 1. Daily Stand-ups
- **Purpose**: A brief daily meeting (typically 15 minutes) to promote alignment and identify roadblocks early.
- **Each team member shares**:
  - ✅ What they accomplished yesterday  
  - 📅 What they plan to do today  
  - 🚧 Any blockers they're facing  

---

### 🧭 2. Sprint Planning (Scrum) vs. Continuous Prioritization (Kanban)

#### 🌀 Sprint Planning (Scrum)
- **When**: At the start of each sprint (usually every 1–2 weeks)
- **Purpose**: Define the sprint goal and select prioritized backlog items
- **Activities**: Estimating effort, task assignment, setting objectives

#### 🔁 Continuous Prioritization (Kanban)
- **When**: Ongoing, as work is completed and capacity opens up
- **Purpose**: Maintain continuous flow of work without time-boxing
- **Activities**: Pulling highest-priority items from backlog as needed

---

### 🔄 3. Retrospectives
- **When**: End of a sprint or project milestone
- **Purpose**: Reflect on the team’s performance and identify areas for improvement
- **Common questions**:
  - 👍 What went well?
  - 👎 What didn’t go well?
  - 🔧 What can we improve next time?

---

### 🗂️ 4. Backlog Refinement (Grooming)
- **When**: Ongoing, typically mid-sprint
- **Purpose**: Ensure the backlog is up to date, prioritized, and ready for development
- **Activities**:
  - Clarifying requirements
  - Estimating effort
  - Splitting large tasks into smaller user stories
  - Removing outdated items

### 🌍 How Do Agile Teams Collaborate Asynchronously and Across Time Zones?

- 🛠️ **Tools**: Jira, Trello, GitHub Projects for task tracking  
- 💬 **Communication**: Slack, MS Teams with async stand-ups (e.g., Geekbot)  
- 📽️ **Video recordings**: Share key updates and demos across time zones  
- 🧾 **Shared documentation**: Notion, Confluence for centralized info  
- ⏰ **Time zone consideration**: Use of overlap hours and rotating meeting times  
- 🔖 **Threaded replies and tagging**: Helps keep conversations clear and organized

### 💬 How Do Agile Ceremonies Help with Communication and Alignment?

Agile ceremonies provide structured touchpoints that promote transparency, accountability, and team unity. They ensure everyone is aligned on goals, aware of blockers, and actively contributing to progress. These ceremonies foster a shared understanding of priorities and promote frequent feedback for continuous improvement.

### 🌟 Most Important Ceremony for My Role

> For my role, **Daily Stand-ups** are the most important.  
They keep the team connected, highlight blockers early, and maintain progress visibility. This consistent sync-up ensures everyone is on track and aligned with the sprint goals.

## 🛠️ Task

### 👀 Observing a Stand-up Meeting

- Structure observed:
  - ✔️ What was completed yesterday
  - 📌 What’s planned today
  - ⚠️ Any current blockers

---

### 💡 One Change to Improve Team Collaboration

- **Introduce a shared "Weekly Priorities" board** (e.g., in Trello or Jira).  
This board will allow team members to list their top 1–3 focus areas for the week.  
It improves transparency, helps with workload balancing, and ensures alignment across roles—especially in distributed teams.

## 🗣️ Personal Anecdote from Stand-up and Retrospective

During a recent daily stand-up meeting I attended in my university, one team member frequently mentioned that their progress was being delayed due to waiting on feedback from the client. This brought to light an external dependency issue that wasn’t fully visible to the team before. The team discussed potential solutions to improve communication with the client, such as setting clearer expectations for response times and scheduling regular check-in calls. This was insightful because it showed how stand-ups help surface blockers quickly so the team can collaboratively find solutions.

At the retrospective following that sprint, the team reflected that although the sprint goal was largely met, some user stories had not been sufficiently detailed before development began. This caused some rework and delays. The team decided to prioritize backlog refinement mid-sprint to better clarify requirements and split larger tasks into smaller, manageable stories. This experience helped me appreciate how retrospectives are crucial for continuous improvement by openly discussing what worked and what didn’t.

## 📅 Description of Participation Evidence


While I don’t have formal notes or screenshots, I actively participated in these meetings as part of my role. During stand-ups, I shared updates on my completed work, plans for the day, and flagged any blockers. For example, on one day I reported finishing a module and planned to start integration testing but noted a potential delay due to awaiting API specifications from the client. On another occasion, I mentioned I was waiting to create a low-fidelity prototype because I needed some key requirements clarified before I could proceed.

Similarly, in retrospectives, I contributed feedback by discussing challenges around unclear user stories and supported the decision to schedule backlog grooming sessions. These verbal contributions and active listening during meetings demonstrate my involvement and understanding of the ceremonies, even without written artifacts.
