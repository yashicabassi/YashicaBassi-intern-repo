## üèÜ Milestone: Iterating & Improving UX Design  
### üîÑ Iterating Based on User Feedback & Product Constraints

---

## üéØ Goal

Learn how to incorporate user feedback into design iterations while balancing product and technical constraints.

---

## ‚ùì Why is this important?

User feedback is valuable, but not every suggestion can (or should) be implemented. UX designers must learn to prioritize meaningful improvements, considering business needs, technical feasibility, and design vision.

---

## üîç Research & Learn

### How do UX designers decide which feedback to act on?

- Prioritize feedback that aligns with business goals and user needs.  
- Focus on issues causing major user pain points or blocking core features.  
- Consider technical feasibility and resource availability before committing.  
- Use data-driven insights (analytics, A/B tests) to validate impact.

### What are best practices for prioritizing UX iterations based on feedback?

- Categorize feedback by severity, frequency, and impact.  
- Balance quick wins with strategic improvements.  
- Involve cross-functional teams (product managers, developers) in prioritization.  
- Use iterative design‚Äîdeploy small changes, measure effects, and refine.

### How do product constraints (business goals, development effort) impact iteration decisions?

- Business goals define which user outcomes are most valuable to support.  
- Technical complexity and available resources limit scope and speed of changes.  
- Designers must balance ideal user experience with what is achievable.  
- Constraints encourage creative compromises to meet core objectives efficiently.

### How can UX designers advocate for usability improvements in a fast-paced product environment?

- Present clear evidence linking UX improvements to business KPIs.  
- Prototype solutions to demonstrate potential impact.  
- Collaborate closely with PMs and developers to align goals.  
- Prioritize changes that deliver measurable value quickly.  
- Communicate user stories and feedback effectively to stakeholders.

## üìù Reflection

### If a UX change benefits users but conflicts with business goals, how would you approach the discussion?

I would present data on user impact alongside business implications and explore compromise options. Emphasizing long-term user satisfaction and retention benefits can help align goals. I‚Äôd seek to understand the business rationale fully and work collaboratively to find a balanced solution that addresses user needs without undermining critical business objectives.

### How can designers work with PMs and developers to find compromises between ideal UX and technical feasibility?

By maintaining open communication, understanding technical constraints, and aligning on priorities. Early involvement in planning helps anticipate challenges. Proposing phased or simplified solutions allows incremental progress. Shared understanding and mutual respect foster creative compromises balancing usability and feasibility.

### What are the risks of making too many small UX changes too quickly?

- User confusion due to inconsistent experience.  
- Increased testing and QA overhead.  
- Difficulty isolating impact of individual changes.  
- Potential performance or stability issues.  
- Overloading development teams, leading to burnout or delays.

### Prioritization Summary

- **High Priority:** Early feature showcase carousel, permission UI improvements, habit-goal alignment, and accessibility compliance (tap size).  
- **Medium Priority:** Personalized mascots, immediate blocking feedback, editing control clarity, and onboarding A/B testing.

## 3. Reflection on Business and Technical Constraints

- Business goals require improving user retention and activation without introducing excessive complexity or user friction.  
- Technical feasibility varies; UI improvements are quicker wins, while backend habit-personalization demands more resources.  
- Iterative deployment with analytics and A/B testing reduces risk and enables data-driven decision making.  
- Advocating usability changes benefits from clearly linking user impact to business KPIs and working collaboratively across teams.
