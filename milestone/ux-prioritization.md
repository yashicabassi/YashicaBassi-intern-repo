# UX Prioritization Proposal

## 🏆 Milestone: Collaboration with Developers & PMs  
### 📊 Working with PMs to Prioritize UX Work  

---

## 🎯 Goal  
Learn how to prioritize UX improvements in collaboration with Product Managers (PMs) while balancing business goals and development timelines.

---

## ❓ Why is this important?  
Not all UX improvements can be implemented immediately—PMs help determine which changes bring the most value within project constraints. Understanding how to advocate for UX work while considering business and technical factors is essential for collaboration.

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### How do PMs decide which UX improvements to prioritize?  
- PMs weigh **user impact**, **development effort**, and **business goals** to select improvements that maximize value within time and resource constraints.  
- They also consider **technical feasibility**, **risk**, and alignment with the product roadmap.

### What factors influence prioritization?  
- **User Impact:** How many users will benefit, and how much will the UX improvement improve their experience?  
- **Development Effort:** How complex and time-consuming is the implementation?  
- **Business Goals:** Does it support revenue, retention, acquisition, or strategic objectives?  
- **Technical Dependencies:** Are there blockers or dependencies on other features or infrastructure?  
- **Urgency and Risk:** Are there critical usability issues causing user churn or support costs?

### How can UX designers make a strong case for usability improvements?  
- Use **qualitative and quantitative data** such as usability testing, user feedback, analytics, and A/B tests.  
- Demonstrate **business impact** — how improved usability reduces costs, increases conversion, or supports KPIs.  
- Present **clear user stories and pain points** to humanize the problem.  
- Collaborate early with PMs to align UX work with product goals.

### What frameworks help balance UX work with feature development?  
- **RICE** (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort): Scores features to prioritize based on impact and effort.  
- **MoSCoW** (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have): Categorizes priorities to clarify essentials versus optional.  
- **Value vs Effort Matrix:** Visualizes impact vs effort to identify quick wins and major projects.

## 📝 Reflection

### If a PM tells you there’s no time for a UX improvement, how would you respond?  
- Understand the constraints and ask about the criteria used for prioritization.  
- Share data showing the potential impact of the UX improvement on key metrics.  
- Suggest smaller, incremental improvements or testing alternatives that fit within time constraints.  
- Offer to revisit prioritization in upcoming cycles or include UX in backlog grooming.

### How can UX designers ensure that important usability issues don’t get ignored?  
- Build strong relationships with PMs and developers to keep communication open.  
- Document and communicate UX issues clearly with evidence and business impact.  
- Advocate for regular UX reviews and usability testing integrated into the development process.  
- Prioritize issues using agreed frameworks and escalate critical problems when needed.

### What’s the best way to present UX work as a business priority rather than a "nice-to-have"?  
- Translate UX improvements into **measurable business outcomes** such as increased conversion, reduced support tickets, or faster onboarding.  
- Frame UX as a key factor in **customer satisfaction and retention**, which directly affect revenue.  
- Use user stories and testimonials to create empathy and urgency.  
- Align UX goals with product KPIs and roadmap priorities.
