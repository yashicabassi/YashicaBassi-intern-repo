### Kanban vs. Scrum: Collaboration Differences

#### 🌀 Scrum
- **Time-boxed sprints** encourage structured collaboration.
- Roles work closely during sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives.
- The Scrum Master facilitates communication and resolves blockers.

#### 🔁 Kanban
- **Continuous flow** of work instead of fixed sprints.
- Less emphasis on roles, more focus on limiting work in progress (WIP).
- Collaboration is task-based and driven by visualizing workflow and bottlenecks.

## 📝 Reflection

### 🙋 My Role and Contribution to the Agile Process

> I work as a **UX Designer** in the Agile team.  
> My primary contribution is to ensure the product is intuitive, accessible, and aligned with user needs. I create wireframes, prototypes, and high-fidelity mockups. I also collaborate with developers and product managers to validate design feasibility and participate in feedback sessions to iterate based on user testing or stakeholder input.

### 🔗 Interactions with Other Roles

> My responsibilities closely interact with the **Front-End Developers**.  
> We work together to ensure that the visual design is translated accurately into code. I provide design specifications, assets, and guidance on user interactions. In return, developers help me understand technical constraints and suggest practical alternatives when needed.

## 🛠️ Task

### 📄 How My Role Fits into the Agile Team

> As a **UX Designer**, I play a critical role in the early stages of product development. I contribute during backlog refinement by ensuring stories include clear UI/UX criteria. I also support sprint planning by estimating design work and collaborate throughout the sprint to review implementation and provide visual QA. My goal is to make sure the user experience remains central to the product.

### 🤝 Improving Teamwork with a Key Collaborator

> One role I frequently collaborate with is the **Front-End Developer**.  
> To improve our teamwork, I can:
> - Share design files and assets earlier in the sprint cycle.
> - Use tools like Figma comments or Loom to explain design decisions asynchronously.
> - Schedule regular design-dev sync-ups to catch discrepancies early and align expectations.
